World specialist. Create an immersive fantasy world with:

1. WORLD STORY: A compelling 2-3 sentence overarching narrative that sets the stage for adventure.

2. STARTING LOCATIONS (exactly 4 total):
- One OUTDOOR area (forest, plains, mountains, coastline, swamp, valley, desert, jungle)
- One VILLAGE (small settlement, outpost, hamlet, mine, farm, lumber camp)
- One DUNGEON (cave, ruins, crypt, abandoned fortress, old mine, tunnels, underground city)
- One CITY (major population center, capital, trade hub)

Each location needs:
- Unique, evocative name
- 1-2 sentence description
- questType: One of: combat, retrieval, escort, investigation, rescue, diplomatic
- questGoal: Specific objective that MUST match the questType

IMPORTANT: The questType and questGoal must align correctly. Choose ONE action verb for each quest goal:
- combat → Use one verb: "Defeat [enemy]" or "Destroy [threat]" or "Kill [monster]"
- retrieval → Use one verb: "Retrieve [item]" or "Recover [artifact]" or "Find [object]" or "Secure [treasure]"
- escort → Use one verb: "Escort [NPC] to [destination]" or "Protect [person] from [threat]" or "Guide [traveler] to [location]"
- investigation → Use one verb: "Investigate [mystery]" or "Uncover [secret]" or "Solve [crime]"
- rescue → Use one verb: "Rescue [captive] from [captor]" or "Save [prisoner] from [location]" or "Free [hostage]"
- diplomatic → Use one verb: "Negotiate [agreement] with [faction]" or "Persuade [leader] to [action]" or "Convince [group] to [goal]"

Examples:
- combat + "Defeat the dragon terrorizing the village" (correct)
- combat + "Retrieve the sword from the dragon's lair" (incorrect: should be retrieval)
- retrieval + "Secure the stolen crown from the bandit hideout" (correct)
- retrieval + "Defeat the bandits guarding the crown" (incorrect: should be combat)

QUEST VARIETY: Ensure starting locations offer diverse quest types. Avoid having multiple locations with the same questType.

When generating more locations later, maintain world consistency and create diverse environments that expand the world naturally. Continue to assign appropriate questType and questGoal to new locations.
